# image_dna

turns images into dna patterns using AI - idk why but its cool

## what it does
- makes ur pics into dna (not real dna obviously lmao)
- compares them to try and guess what edited photos came fro mthe same image
- spits out some fancy looking graphs

## setup stuff

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DylanMcBean/image_dna.git
cd image_dna
pip install torch numpy opencv-python matplotlib pillow tqdm scikit-learn
```

make a folder called `./data` and shove some images in there, the more the better but also it'll take longer to train.

## requirements n stuff
- python (duh)
- bunch of other packages that pip will handle (hopefully)
- a computer (probably)
- patience when it breaks

makes some cool visualizations and stuff. if it breaks just restart it lol
